The Three-Body Problem (Chinese: 三体; lit. 'Three-Body'; pinyin: sān tǐ) is a science fiction novel by the Chinese writer Liu Cixin. The title refers to the three-body problem in orbital mechanics. It is the first novel of the Remembrance of Earth's Past (Chinese: 地球往事) trilogy, but Chinese readers generally call the whole series The Three-Body Problem.[1] The trilogy's second and third novels are The Dark Forest and Death's End.

The Three-Body Problem was serialized in Science Fiction World in 2006 and published as a book in 2008. It became one of the most popular science fiction novels in China.[2] It received the Chinese Science Fiction Yinhe ("Galaxy") Award in 2006.[3] A Chinese film adaptation of the same name was in production by 2015, but halted soon after.

The English translation by Ken Liu was published by Tor Books in 2014.[4] Thereafter, it became the first Asian novel ever to win a Hugo Award for Best Novel,[5][6] and was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel.[7]

The series portrays a future where, in the first book, the Earth is awaiting an invasion from the closest star system, which in this universe consists of three solar-type stars orbiting each other in an unstable three-body system, with a single Earth-like planet unhappily being passed among them and suffering extremes of heat and cold, as well as the repeated destruction of its intelligent civilizations.
