The Martian is a 2011 science fiction novel written by Andy Weir. It is his debut novel under his own name.[a] The book was originally self-published in 2011 and later re-released by Crown Publishing in 2014 after Crown purchased the exclusive publishing rights. The story follows an American astronaut, Mark Watney, as he becomes stranded alone on Mars in 2035[1] and must improvise in order to survive.[2][3][4] A film adaptation, The Martian, directed by Ridley Scott and starring Matt Damon, was released in October 2015.[5] 

In the year 2035,[6] the crew of NASA's Ares 3 mission have arrived at Acidalia Planitia for a planned month-long stay on Mars. After only six sols, an intense dust and wind storm threatens to topple their Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), which would trap them on the planet. During the hurried evacuation, an antenna tears loose and impales astronaut Mark Watney, a botanist and engineer, also disabling his spacesuit radio. He is flung out of sight by the wind and presumed dead. As the MAV teeters dangerously, mission commander Melissa Lewis has no choice but to take off without completing the search for Watney.
