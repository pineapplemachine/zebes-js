RAR is a proprietary archive file format that supports data compression, error recovery and file spanning.[3] It was developed in 1993 by Russian software engineer Eugene Roshal and the software is licensed by win.rar GmbH.[3] The name RAR stands for Roshal Archive. 

The filename extensions used by RAR are .rar for the data volume set and .rev for the recovery volume set. Previous versions of RAR split large archives into several smaller files, creating a "multi-volume archive". Numbers were used in the file extensions of the smaller files to keep them in the proper sequence. The first file used the extension .rar, then .r00 for the second, and then .r01, .r02, etc.
